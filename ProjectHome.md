Welcome to the KGP - KGP Group of Programmers Community. We're a bunch of IIT Kharagpur students, who've gathered for a new era in IIT Kgp's coding standards. We wish to agglomerate bright programmers and smart hackers to do QUALITY and EFFECTIVE work under our guidance.

The purpose we wish to fulfil is to make an organised effort to teach people how to code effectively and also to make them aware of important practices such as coding communities, open source!

This website is developed by Sumit Dhoble, Me( Sanket Agarwal ) and Rohit Hiwale as a start to this avenue! It is developed exclusively in Django, the Python web framework.

Contribution: Models: Sanket Agarwal
> Templates and Views: Sumit Dhoble.

You can see the list of applications that we've picked up from the web, preferably from django-pluggables, at our wiki. Other information is also forming up at wiki, do have a look in case you wish to browse and/or use our code.
